### Detection and Classification of Type of Electrical Fault in the transmission lines in a Power Ditribution Network
We have trained various Machine Learning Models to find out the best ML model suited for predicting as well as classyfying the type of electrical fault present in the Transmission lines of a typical Power Distribution Networks. The data required for Training the models are the *Voltage* and *Current* values in each phase of the transmission line.
